            Glad you made it this far! My name is Anson Kwan and I am based in
            Auckland, New Zealand. Currently I am a second year Software
            Engineering student at The University of Auckland. I also spent a
            year abroad at The University of Sydney as a Dalyell Scholar in
            2019.

            <br></br>
            Upon returning to Auckland, I rediscovered my passion for web
            development. Now I spend my free time learning to develop web
            applications, chasing efficiency and perfection in the process.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>I am constantly in search of a meaningful avenue to express
            my skills.
